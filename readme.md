# Video-Based Motion Extraction and Amplification


## Problem Statement:

Develop a system to extract and enhance otherwise invisible motion from a video, or a
live video feed.

## Motivation:

To be comfortable with theoretical concepts of image processing through their pragmatic
usage in real-world applications.

## Objectives:

    1) To reveal temporal variations in videos that are diffi-
    cult or impossible to see with the naked eye and display them in
    an indicative manner.
    2) Motion with low spatial amplitude, while
    hard or impossible for humans to see, can be magnified to reveal
    interesting mechanical behavior.
    3) To visualize the flow
    of blood as it fills the face and also to amplify and reveal small
    motions.
    
## Applications in Real world:

    1) To measure the pulse rate, or breathing rate, of people (or animals) using non
    intrusive methods, and without physical contact.
    2) Detection and amplification of vibrations in mechanical equipment to identify potential
    faults and facilitate timely maintenance.
    3) Amplify and analyze the motion of celestial bodies or phenomena, aiding astronomers
    in studying subtle changes in the night sky.
    4) To use as a video special effect for motion pictures, or social media.

## IP Algorithm/Concept to be used:

    1) Eulerian Video Magnification:
    To amplify motion, this method does not perform feature
    tracking or optical flow computation, but merely magnifies temporal color changes using
    spatio-temporal processing. This Eulerian-based method, which temporally processes
    pixels in a fixed spatial region, successfully reveals informative signals and amplifies
    small motions in real-world videos.
## Choice of Programming Language(s):

1)Python
2)Matlab
